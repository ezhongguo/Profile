### Selected Project
<a name="Predictive"></a> 
#### Predictive Modeling for Bike-Sharing Usage
**Code:** [LINK](https://github.com/ezhongguo/Bike-Sharing-Usage/blob/main/Predictive%20Modeling%20for%20Bike-Sharing%20Usage.ipynb)
* **Description:**
The project focuses on building predictive models to forecast pick-up and drop-off counts at bike-sharing stations. Utilizing historical data on weather conditions and bike-sharing usage, linear regression models were developed to provide insights into the optimal allocation of bikes and docks at specific stations.
* **Role:** Responsible for data preprocessing, feature selection, model development, and evaluation.
* **Team Size:** 4
* **Skills:**
  * Data Analysis and Preprocessing
  * Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning
  * Python Programming (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
  * Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  * Linear Regression and Model Evaluation Metrics

#### SQL Data Processing for NYC Vehicle Collisions Analysis
**Code:** [LINK](https://github.com/ezhongguo/NYC-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/blob/main/NYC%20Motor%20Vehicle%20Collisions.ipynb)
* **Description:**
This project focuses on analyzing New York City Motor Vehicle Collisions (MVC) data from 2016 to 2022. We aim to provide actionable insights to stakeholders like car insurance companies, NYPD Traffic Enforcement, and the New York Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) by exploring trends, patterns, and contributing factors related to MVCs.We use Shell Commands for data acquisition and basic preprocessing, and SQL in AWS for data manipulation, analysis, and database management.
* **Role:** Responsible for data cleaning and exploration, Star-schema design and implementation and SQL table creation and query writing for analysis
* **Team Size:** 7
* **Skills:**
  * Shell Commands: Used for data acquisition, file renaming, and initial preprocessing.
  * SQL in AWS: Create table, querying, analysis, and AWS database management.
    
<a name="Statistical"></a>
#### Statistical Models for Economic Growth Rate Analysis
**Code:** [LINK](https://github.com/ezhongguo/Economic-Growth-Rate/blob/main/Economic%20Growth%20Rate%20Analysis.ipynb)
* **Description:**
This project aims to investigate the relationship between economic indicators and GDP growth rate. We analyze various factors such as inflation rate, unemployment rate, real interest rate, primary school enrollment rate, and their impact on GDP growth. Using multivariate linear regression models, we aim to identify the most influential factors affecting economic growth across different time periods and countries. 
* **Role:** Responsible for data cleaning, preprocessing, and statistical analysis.
* **Team Size:** 4
* **Skills:**
  * Data Wrangling
    Pandas: Data manipulation, reading Excel, and renaming columns.
  * Linear Regression
    Statsmodels: Statistical modeling and linear regression.
    Sklearn: Data splitting with train_test_split.
  * Data Visualization
    Matplotlib: Basic plots, like scatter plots for GDP growth.
    Seaborn: Enhanced visual scatter plots.

#### PowerBI Supply Chain Analysis Dashboard
**DEMO Video:** [LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KkYsJomkshiyImQrWUQov4wq_FqQE8zk/view?usp=sharing)
![Supply Chain Analysis Dashboard](https://github.com/ezhongguo/Profile/assets/138747553/14d6ae49-bec8-4e66-80d3-144ff9548b24)
* **Dashboard Statement:**
Guided by DataLiteracy4All's tutorial and utilizing a sample dataset, I crafted a supply chain analysis dashboard emphasizing inventory and order level insights. This dashboard offers a holistic view of warehouse operations and order processing and showcases vital metrics such as Revenue, Cost, Profit, and Transactions. Enhanced by slicers, users can easily filter data by Warehouse Code, Product Name, and Channel Level.
Key features of the dashboard include:
  * **Inventory in Progress:** A visual representation of inventory that has been ordered but remains in our warehouse, providing insights into pending shipments.
  * **Order in Progress:** Displays the number of orders between order and delivery dates, providing insights into order processing and delivery timelines.
* **Skills:**
  * Power BI Visualization: Crafting interactive charts and graphs. 
  * Power Query: Creating Date Table and cleaning the dataset.
  * DAX Function: Implementing advanced data calculations in Power BI.

### MyStanCodeProjects
<a name="Baby"></a>
#### Baby names
* **DEMO Video:** [LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EREk00LTtlER3VqBbw1kDceA5bLc0Afo/view?usp=sharing)
* **Code:** [LINK](https://github.com/ezhongguo/MyStanCodeProjects/tree/main/Babynames)
* **Description:**
This project is focused on analyzing and visualizing baby names data across various years. The program reads data from text files containing baby names ranked by popularity for each year and provides functionalities to add new data, search for names, and visualize the historical trends of selected names. 
* **Skills:**
Implemented a dictionary-based data structure for baby names, handled file operations, developed data manipulation functions, implemented a search feature, collaborated on GUI development using tkinter, visualized data with line charts, and managed error handling.

#### <a name="anagram"></a>Word Search - anagram
* **DEMO Video:** [LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dutHTsvSueqjCnCZzLJgej_FdrwrSrlq/view?usp=sharing)
* **Code:** [LINK](https://github.com/ezhongguo/MyStanCodeProjects/blob/main/Anagram/anagram.py)
* **Description:**
The Anagram project finds all anagrams for a user-input word using recursive permutation generation and dictionary validation.
* **Skills:**
Implemented file handling to read an English dictionary, used recursion for permutation generation to find anagrams, managed data with lists and pairs, measured execution time, and optimized permutation generation with prefix checking.

#### <a name="Web"></a>Web Crawler
* **Code:** [LINK](https://github.com/ezhongguo/MyStanCodeProjects/blob/main/Web%20Crawler/webcrawler.py)
* **Description:**
This project fetches data from three URLs containing baby name statistics for the decades 2010s, 2000s, and 1990s from the Social Security Administration's website. The program currently prints cumulative rankings for male and female names.
* **Skills:**
Web Scraping: Used requests to fetch HTML, BeautifulSoup for parsing, extracted data from tables, manipulated text, iterated through tables, and performed counting and aggregation. Printed results to the console.
